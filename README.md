# ZenToast

**ZenToast** is a minimalist, modern notification addon for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (WotLK). It replaces the default system messages for friends coming online and offline with sleek, non-intrusive "toast" notifications.

## Features

- **Modern Aesthetics**: Dark, flat design with a clean look.
- **Class Icons**: Instantly recognize the class of the friend coming online with standard class icons.
- **Smart Stacking**: Displays up to 3 notifications at once, automatically recycling the oldest ones.
- **Combat Suppression**: Prevents distractions by suppressing notifications while you are in combat.
- **Zone Filters**: Options to hide notifications while in Raids, Battlegrounds, or Arenas.
- **Mass Broadcast**: Includes a "Broadcast to friends" input box in the Friends Frame to easily whisper all online friends at once.
- **Interactive**:
  - **Left Click**: Whispers the friend.
  - **Right Click**: Opens the dropdown menu (Invite, Target, etc.).

## Installation

1. Download the `ZenToast` folder.
2. Place it in your `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\` directory.
